Mars Subsurface Ice Model (M-SIM) Collection: Equilibrium Ice Table
===================================================================


jsub.f90:
	net vapor flux between ice table and surface; includes thermal model

jsubv.f90:
	vectorized version of jsub; includes emission from one surface to another
	for planar slopes

mars_mapi.f: (main program)
	determines equilibrium ice table depth for a list of locations (such as
	the entire globe) using the bisection method

mars_mapii.f90: (main program)
	determines equilibrium ice table depth for a list of locations;
	same functionality as mars_mapi.f, but uses an iteration method

mapgrid.dat:
	Example input file for mars_mapi.f and mars_mapt.f

mars_mapt.f: (main program)
	calculates temperatures and other variables for a list of locations;
	calls jsub for a list of locations (such as the entire globe)

mars_mapi2p.f90: (main program)
        calculates temperatures on thermally coupled planar slopes;
	also calculates equilibrium ice table depths;
	configured for parallel job execution

mapgrid.slp:
	example input file for mars_mapi2p.f90

mars_mapi2p_go.cmd
	shell script for parallel execution of mars_mapi2p
	



makefile:
	shows file dependencies
