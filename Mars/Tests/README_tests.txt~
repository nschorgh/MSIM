Examples for validation:
========================

1. Equilibrium ice table for a list of sites:

make mars_mapi

./a.out

reads inputs from mapgrid.dat and outputs mapgrid2.dat



2. Ice retreat at Phoenix Landing site over the last 2000 years:

make mars_fast

./mars_fast ph

This will read input file lats.ph and produce output files depths.ph and depthF.ph
