This directory contains C versions of the 1D Crank-Nicolson solver with
Stefan-Boltzmann law as upper boundary condition, conductionQ, and a standard
Crank-Nicolson solver, conductionT.

The output stored in the subdirectory Test/ was produced with the Fortran
version, but also applies to the C version.
The output of testcrankT.c can be verified with test_Tprofile.m.
The output of testcrankQ.c is Tprofile_testcrankQ.
