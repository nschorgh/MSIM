Common subroutines and functions 


* These have no modules and use no modules,
unless that module is only used in its own source file.

* No main programs in this directory either.

* Instructions for subroutines from Numerical Recipes:
- tridag.for  NMAX=1000, remove stop and pause statements
- julday.for  remove pause statement
