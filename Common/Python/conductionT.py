#   conductionT:  program to calculate the diffusion of temperature

#                 and variable thermal properties on irregular grid
#   Crank-Nicholson scheme, flux conservative
#
#   Eqn: rhoc*T_t = (k*T_z)_z 
#   BC (z=0): T=T(t)
#   BC (z=L): heat flux = Fgeotherm
#
#   nz = number of grid points
#   dt = time step
#   T = vertical temperature profile [K]  (in- and output)
#   Tsurf, Tsurfp1 = surface temperatures at times n and n+1  
#   ti = thermal inertia [J m^-2 K^-1 s^-1/2]  VECTOR
#   rhoc = rho*c  heat capacity per volume [J m^-3 K^-1]  VECTOR
#   ti and rhoc are not allowed to vary in the layers immediately
#               adjacent to the surface or the bottom
#   Fgeotherm = geothermal heat flux at bottom boundary [W/m^2]
#   Fsurf = heat flux at surface [W/m^2]  (output)
#
#   Grid: surface is at z=0
#         T[1] is at z[1]; ...; T[i] is at z[i]
#         k[i] is midway between z[i-1] and z[i]
