This directory contains Matlab/Octave versions of the 1D Crank-Nicolson solver 
with Stefan-Boltzmann law as upper boundary condition, conductionQ, and a 
standard Crank-Nicolson solver, conductionT.

The output stored in the subdirectory Test/ was produced with the Fortran
version, but also applies to the Matlab version.
The output of testcrankT.m can be verified with test_Tprofile.m.
The output of testcrankQ.m is Tprofile_testcrankQ.
