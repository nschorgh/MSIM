Log of major changes (going back to times before git version control)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

15 Apr 2023: Release v1.2.1  doi:10.5281/zenodo.7832269
Major reorganization of repository since last release, but almost no changes in functionality.

2 Dec 2022: Added old data outputs (maps of equilibrium ice table) to repository.

19 Apr 2022: Moved MSIM from the Planetary-Code-Collection to its own repository.
             First dedicated release for MSIM (v1.2.0) doi:10.5281/zenodo.6499709

Jan 2021: added mars_mapii, which has the same functionality as mars_mapi, but uses simple iterations to calculate the equilibrium ice table depth instead of the bisection method. Both use the thermal model in jsub.

Jan 2021: replaced many array allocations of static length NMAX with user-defined length NZ.

10 Jul 2020: merged psv + psv2 + psv3, and changed default parameterization to psv2.

27 May 2020: changed psv3, added psv2 (parametrizations for saturation vapor pressure)

22 May 2020: added patm as input to Mars/jsubv; changed default hemispheric Tco2frost temperatures

May 2020: Re-calculated mean annual surface temperatures on Mars over 21 Myr and added them to the archive under Mars/MilankOutput/  (now MarsThermal/MilankOutput)

16 May 2020: flux -> flux_mars77 in jsubv. This was the last occurrence of the function flux, and the legendary function flux was removed from the collection. It is superseded by subroutine mars_flux2, which provides a consistent treatment of the sky irradiance for an obstructed sky. For horizontal and unobstructed ground flux_mars77 can be used.

May 2020: dusted off mars_mapiqh2v, renamed it to mars_mapi2p, and added example output in Mars/Test/ (new MarsThermal/Test)

14 Apr 2020: dug up analytical solution to heat equation with Stefan-Boltzmann law as boundary condition; added to UserGuide section 1.1. 

28 Feb 2020: added tempr_driver.f90 (was used to make Fig. 3 in my 2008 Milankovitch paper)

22 Oct 2019: flux -> flux_mars77  in jsub, mars_mapi, mars_mapt2, and fast_subs_mars
Functions flux and flux_mars77 do not return the exact same results, because in flux_mars77 the atmospheric short-wavelength scattered irradiance is multiplied with (1-albedo).

21 Oct 2019: Added Mars/Tests/  (now */Test/)

20 Sep 2019: The long-used and much-used subroutine conductionQ received an upgrade. It now iterates when the surface temperature, which is the initial value for the linearization of the thermal radiation term, changes too fast. It was also converted from Fortran 77 to Fortran 90 (or Fortran 2008 actually). The old version of conductionQ is still available in release 1.1.5 and all earlier releases. The new version is conductionQ.f90. The change has also been propagated into conductionQ2.f90

Sep 2018: function flux_mars is replaced by subroutine flux_mars2, which returns direct and diffuse irradiances separately

Aug 2018: moved mars-specific subroutines out of grids.f

9 Oct 2016: First version of User Guide (the predecessor of MSIM_Methods.pdf)

Aug 2015: moved to GitHub

3/4 Jun 2014: changed NMAX=2000 to NMAX=1000 almost everywhere

4 Sep 2011: better implementation of "mode 2" ice growth, affecting fast_subs_mars.f90 and fast_subs_univ.f90

25 Aug 2011: generalizations to mars_fast.f90, fast_modules.f90, and fast_subs_mars.f90

20 Jul 2011: technical updates (generalizations) to grids.f, jsub.f, mars_mapt2.f, and mars_mapi.f

28 Mar 2010: updated fast_subs_mars.f90; icelayer_mars has been parallelized, but parallelization is disabled by default; fewer calls to conductionT in ajsub_mars

27 Mar 2010: minor polish of the very old program mars_thermal1d.f

9 Feb 2010: grids.f has an additional subroutine and the default for the parametrization of thermal conductivity has changed.

2 Jan 2010: routines for fast method have been added. Their filenames contain the string fast.

Summer 2009: switched from g95/g77 to gfortran compiler.

31 Oct 2008: added deriv1_onesided to derivs.f90
